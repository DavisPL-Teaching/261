## Thursday, February 19

Announcements/reminders:

- Project proposals - we are working on grading and feedback, will get them back to you soon!

- I will need to leave class right at 6pm today.
  OH most likely on Monday morning (say, 9am or 10am) on Zoom,
  I will confirm Sunday night.

- HW3 due next Tuesday - Feb 24 11:59pm

Plan:

- Hoare logic, continued.

If time:

- First-order logic

- Definitions of weakest preconditions, strongest postconditions.

Questions?

## Tuesday, February 24

Announcements/reminders:

- Proposal feedback is back - please let us know if you have questions!

  Special thanks to the TA for getting the feedback back as I wanted you to get feedback
  back to you ASAP and I had to be away over the weekend.

  Two comments of things we noticed in particular:

  1. Some people said they would implement in Python first, then Dafny.

    Probably don't do this!! Just impl in Dafny, you can compile it to Python.
    (same with any other lang)

    the Python part would be useful for interfacing with other libraries, or if you want
    to build a GUI or some other runnable version of your code.

  2. Timeline: think about the "easy goal", "target goal", "reach goal" framework!

      Easy goal: what can you complete by end of this week?

      Target goal: what can you complete by the end of next week project presentations?

      Reach goal: if you complete the work early, what features/extensions will you implement?

    Helps ensure you have a "complete" deliverable product - even if it doesn't have all the
    bells and whistles - by the end of the project.

    Deadlines:

      + Project presentations: last 3 class periods

      + Final project reports: will be due March 19, 11:59pm (day before final exam).

        Final exam: March 20, 6-8pm

        Not ideal, but I think this is slightly better than being due the same day as the final.

- HW3: deadline extend to **tomorrow Wednesday** 11:59pm

  + extra OH on Zoom tomorrow:

      Looks like 10am was most popular

  + I have updated the deadline in Gradescope

Plan for today:

- finish Hoare logic, loose ends

  + incl. Definitions of weakest preconditions, strongest postconditions.

- part 2: first-order logic.
