- Due Monday: HW2

Plan:

- A problem from last time that will be helpful on the homework

- Start with some slides

- Intro to interactive verification in Dafny
  starting with some examples, then first-order logic, then program logics.

Also covered on slides:

- A note on industry applications

- Some help on the project:

## Thursday, May 1

Announcements:

- I am moving the project proposal deadline back 1 week to Friday, May 9.
  And we will spend the first part of today doing some mini verification exercises in Dafny
