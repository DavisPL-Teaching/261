# Poll answers

April 1:
Either answer is valid (it depends on the definition you came up with).

April 3: E Only.
"The input to is_even is always between 0 and 4" is not a valid specification as it is a property
that constraints how is_even is used, not a true-or-false property about the function itself.

April 8 poll #1:
True, False
A, B, C, E, and G.

April 8 poll #2:
all of row 4, all of column 3, and the diagonal, and 1 => 2.
