# Lecture 4: Proofs and programs

This lecture will study the foundations behind proofs and programs,
and what is going on behind the scenes with examples in Dafny.

We have seen:

- proofs in FOL

Underlying question:

- How do proofs relate to programs?

We will study three topics:
Hoare logic, dynamic logic, and the Curry-Howard correspondence.

Emphasize that the reasons to care about these topics
are to excel at practical applications.
