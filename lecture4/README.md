# Lecture 4: Proofs and programs

We know about proofs (in first-order logic);
let's see about programs.

This lecture will give you the foundations behind how Dafny works.
It will be more theoretical compared to Lecture 3.
We will study three things:
Hoare logic, dynamic logic, and the Curry-Howard correspondence.

Emphasize that the reasons to care about these topics
are to excel at practical applications.
