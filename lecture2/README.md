# Lecture 2: Program Verification

Introduction to interactive program verification in Dafny.

## Tuesday, January 27

Announcements/reminders:

- I am still sick, hope to be back in person soon

- Polls synced over the weekend -- if you have a 0 on all polls, check
  that you have submitted HW0 with your email and student ID.

Lecture plan going forward:

- I am going to switch Lecture 2 and Lecture 3 from how it was taught last iteration of
  the class.

  + This means we will start with Dafny, then come back to Z3 later.

  + Reason: I want to give you experience with Dafny earlier on as it will be useful
    for the final project!

- Plan for today:

  + Loose ends from Lecture 1 + the poll

  + Introductory slides for lecture 2

  + Introduction to Dafny.
