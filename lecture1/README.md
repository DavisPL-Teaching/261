2. Start with a poll
3. Finish demos from last time
4. Introduction to program specifications

## Following along

You can follow along with the lectures!

- https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/261
- `git clone git@github.com:DavisPL-Teaching/261.git`
  (Every week to get the latest changes: `git stash` then `git pull`)
- Also allows you to access the poll link we do in lecture.
- You will need to complete HW0 to be able to run the code successfully.

## Topics covered over the next few lectures:

(Overflow) Demos from last time explained in a bit more detail (~15 min)

1. Program specifications

    - Writing specifications
    - Testing specifications

2. Exploring and testing specifications with Hypothesis

    (Putting Dafny aside for a bit - we will come back to Dafny in a few weeks!)

3. Facets

    - Types of specifications
    - Preconditions and postconditions

4. Limitations and discussion

    - Specification is wrong

    - Specification is incomplete

    - Program model is wrong

    - Precondition is wrong

    - Mutability issues

    - Techniques for validating specifications

    - Important distinctions (terminology to be aware of)
        + Testing vs. verification
        + Static/dynamic
        + Soundness/completeness
        + White-box vs. black-box

## Key definitions

(We can come back and fill these in post-lecture)

**Specification:**

**Testing** vs **Verification**

**Safety property:**

**Precondition** and **Postcondition**

**Assert** and **Assume**

## Poll

Today's poll:

- Some questions about your prior background (to help me out with gauging the material)

- Question asking you to think about specifications for the is_even function
