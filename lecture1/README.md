## Topics covered over the next few lectures:

(Overflow) Demos from last time explained in a bit more detail (~15 min)

1. Program specifications

    - Writing specifications
    - Types of specifications
    - Preconditions and postconditions

2. A way of exploring specifications: Hypothesis

    (Putting Dafny aside for a bit - we will come back to Dafny in a few weeks!)

3. Limitations and discussion

    - Specification is wrong

    - Specification is incomplete

    - Program model is wrong

    - Precondition is wrong

    - Mutability issues

    - Techniques for validating specifications

    - Important distinctions (terminology to be aware of)
        + Testing vs. verification
        + Static/dynamic
        + Soundness/completeness
        + White-box vs. black-box

## Key definitions

**Specification:**

**Safety property:**

**Precondition:**

**Postcondition:**
