## Presentation

(Please note: this outline is provided for informational purposes and is subject to change!)

Please come prepared with your slides and a laptop that can plug in to usb-c, and give everyone in the group an equal chance to present. Please be sure to practice your presentation to stay within the time limit!

Before you jump into your project (what you did), start with at least 2-3 slides of general background on the area and problem.
Show us at least 1 slide that has code (for example, a method with its preconditions and postconditions), but no more than 2 such slides.
You don't have to be fully finished with your project by the time of the presentation, but you should have made significant progress.

Include some slides with what you want feedback on! Questions for the audience: should we do X, or should we do Y? How can we help guide your project in the remaining time before the final report?

Include a Q+A at the end of your presentation. Additionally, please include 5 "optional" slides that include candidate questions that the audience might ask, in case you do not get any questions or if there is ample extra time.
