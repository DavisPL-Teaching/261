# Final project presentations

Final project presentations will be in class on May 27, May 29, June 3, and June 5.
I will post a sign-up closer to that date.
Here are some guidlines for your presentation.

## Guidelines

**Basic details:** You will have 10 minutes to present (not including Q+A) on the topic of your project including your project goals, results, and any challenges you faced/are facing.

Be prepared to fill the full 10 minutes with your slides, demo, or walkthrough.
However, be careful not to go overtime! If you go longer than 10 minutes, we may need to cut you off. Plan some slides that you can skip if you are short on time.
As a rule of thumb, aim for about 1 slide per minute (on average).
I do recommend carefully rehearsing and timing your presentation beforehand.

There will be 5-10 minutes of time for Q+A after your presentation. You should plan to have some backup slides for your Q+A in case no one asks anything (see below).
The amount of time for Q+A will depend on if there is buffer time in between the presentations (e.g., someone has difficulty setting up), and depending on the number of presentations that day.
However, I will ensure that it is always at least 5 and no more than 10 minutes, including set up time for the next presenter. I will monitor the time for the Q+A as needed.

If you are in a group, each person should present part of your project (aim for roughly equal speaking time per participant).

You may choose from the following options: prepare slides, show a demo, or walk us through your report (@23):

**Slides:** Plan for 10 slides, plus 10 slides of Q+A. Include some examples and questions interspersed with your slides to get the audience engaged! Focus on your key findings, and the comparison between the papers that you did. Don't aim to explain each paper in detail (which you probably won't have time to do in 10 minutes!)

- **Demo:** Have some examples ready to try with your demo. Prepare a few backup slides (3-5) or notes to ensure you can fill the time if needed.

- **Report walk-through:** This option is only available if your final report is already complete. Prepare some notes about what to talk about to ensure you can fill the 10 minutes. As with the demo option, prepare a few backup slides (3-5) or backup notes with questions or examples in case you run out of time.

## For the presentation day

Please come prepared with your slides and a laptop that can plug in to USB-C, and give everyone in the group an equal chance to present.

Before you jump into your project (what you did), start with at least 2-3 slides (or equivalent) of general background on the area and problem.
Show us at least 1 slide that has code (for example, a method with its preconditions and postconditions), but no more than 2 such slides.
You don't have to be fully finished with your project by the time of the presentation, but you should have made significant progress.

Include some slides with what you want feedback on! Questions for the audience: should we do X, or should we do Y? How can we help guide your project in the remaining time before the final report?

Include a Q+A at the end of your presentation. Additionally, please include 10 "optional" slides that include candidate questions that the audience might ask, in case you do not get any questions or if there is ample extra time.
