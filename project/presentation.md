# Final project presentations

Final project presentations will be in class on March 5, 10, and 12.
Please sign up for a slot on Piazza!
Here are some guidelines for your presentation.

## Guidelines

### Structure and timing

**Basic details:** You will have 8-10 minutes to present on the topic of your project including your project goals, results, and any challenges you faced/are facing, plus 3-5 minutes of Q+A.

Please don't go overtime!
Be prepared to fill at least 8 minutes with your slides, demo, or walkthrough.
I will have to cut presentations off after exactly 10 minutes and will give a 2-minute warning at 8 minutes.
I recommend carefully rehearsing and timing your presentation beforehand, and having some
content that you can skip in case of time.

There will be 3-5 minutes of time for Q+A after your presentation. You should plan to prepare 5 backup slides for your Q+A with example questions (1 question per slide) in case no one asks anything (see below).
The amount of time for Q+A will depend on if there is buffer time in between the presentations (e.g., someone has difficulty setting up).
However, I will ensure that it is always at least 3 and no more than 5 minutes, including set up time for the next presenter. I will monitor the time for the Q+A as needed.

If you are in a group, each person should present part of your project (aim for roughly equal speaking time per participant).

### Options

You may choose from the following two options: prepare slides or show a demo:

- **Slides:** Plan for 8-10 slides (I would set 10 as a maximum), plus the 5 Q+A slides. Plan some slides that you can skip if you are short on time. A good rule of thumb is to aim for about 1 slide per minute (on average).

- **Demo:** Show us a demo of your tool! Have some specific examples ready to try with your demo. For this option, please prepare 3-5 backup slides in case they are needed to fill the time, along with your 5 backup Q+A slides.

You can combine the two options as you see fit (e.g., 4-5 slides + a shorter demo).
Once again, please prepare a few additional backup slides in addition to the Q+A slides in case they are needed to fill the time.

### Content (for the slides option)

Include some examples and questions interspersed with your slides to get the audience engaged! Focus on your key findings. Don't aim to explain your work in detail (which you probably won't have time to do in 10 minutes!)

Before you jump into your project (what you did), start with at least 2-3 slides (or equivalent) of general background on the area and problem.
Show us at least 1 slide that has code (for example, a method with its preconditions and postconditions), but no more than 2 such slides.
You don't have to be fully finished with your project by the time of the presentation, but you should have made significant progress.

Include some slides with what you want feedback on! Questions for the audience: should you do X, or should you do Y? How can we (your audience) help guide your direction?

Include a Q+A at the end of your presentation, followed by your backup 5 Q+A slides.

### For the presentation day

If you are the first group to present, please come early!
Please come prepared with your slides and a laptop that can plug in to USB-C or HDMI, and give everyone in the group an equal chance to present.

Changes to the schedule will not be possible on the same day as the presentation (see Piazza).
You may make changes at least 24 hours in advance if you agree with another group to switch.
